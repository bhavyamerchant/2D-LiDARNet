# 2D-LiDARNet
# Originally created for Math 4339: Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning at University of Houston with the Dr. Skripnikov and Dr. Poliak as instructors
# Purpose - to create a neural network model that could correctly identify vegetation vs no vegetation from cross sectional images from LiDAR
# We obtained LiDAR scans of Enchanted Rock during the EAS Geophysics Summer Field Camp in 2018 and performed preprocessing methods
# The "Preprocessing.R" script shows how the preprocessing was performed.
